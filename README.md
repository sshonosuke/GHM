# GHM: Grouped Heterogeneous Mixture Modeling for Clustered Data
This package implements mixture models for clustered data, as proposed by the following paper.

Sugasawa, S. (2020). Grouped Heterogeneous Mixture Modeling for Clustered Data. https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00888

Functions are implemented in *GHM-Gauss-function.R* and *GHM-Po-function.R* for continous and count responses, respectively.
